  abstract =     {Comparison of graph structures is a frequently
                  encountered problem across a number of problem
                  domains.  Comparing graphs requires a metric to
                  discriminate which features of the graphs are
                  considered important. The spectrum of a graph is
                  often claimed to contain all the information within
                  a graph, but the raw spectrum contains too much
                  information to be directly used as a useful
                  metric. In this paper we introduce a metric, the
                  weighted spectral distribution, that improves on the
                  raw spectrum by discounting those eigenvalues
                  believed to be unimportant and emphasizing the
                  contribution of those believed to be important.  We
                  use this metric to optimize the selection of
                  parameter values for generating Internet
                  topologies. Our metric leads to parameter choices
                  that appear sensible given prior knowledge of the
                  problem domain: the resulting choices are close to
                  the default values of the topology generators and,
                  in the case of the AB generator, fall within the
                  expected region. This metric provides a means for
                  meaningfully optimizing parameter selection when
                  generating topologies intended to share structure
                  with, but not match exactly, measured graphs.},

  abstract =     {Many models have been proposed to generate Internet
                  Autonomous System (AS) topologies, most of which
                  make structural assumptions about the AS graph. In
                  this paper we compare AS topology generation models
                  with several observed AS topologies. In contrast to
                  most previous works, we avoid making assumptions
                  about which topological properties are important to
                  characterize the AS topology. Our analysis shows
                  that, although matching degree-based properties, the
                  existing AS topology generation models fail to
                  capture the complexity of the local interconnection
                  structure between ASs. Furthermore, we use BGP data
                  from multiple vantage points to show that additional
                  measurement locations significantly affect local
                  structure properties, such as clustering and node
                  centrality. Degree-based properties, however, are
                  not notably affected by additional measurements
                  locations.  These observations are particularly
                  valid in the core.  The shortcomings of AS topology
                  generation models stems from an underestimation of
                  the complexity of the connectivity in the core
                  caused by inappropriate use of BGP data.},

  abstract =     {The open nature of Internet services has been of
                  great value to users, enabling dramatic innovation
                  and evolution of services. However, this openness
                  permits many abuses of open-access Internet services
                  such as web, email, and DNS. To counteract such
                  abuses, a number of so called proof-of-work schemes
                  have been proposed. They aim to prevent or limit
                  such abuses by demanding potential clients of the
                  service to prove that they have carried out some
                  amount of work before they will be served. In this
                  paper we show that existing resource-based schemes
                  have several problems, and instead propose
                  latency-based proof-of-work as a solution. We
                  describe centralised and distributed variants,
                  introducing the problem class of non-parallelisable
                  shared secrets in the process. We also discuss
                  application of this technique at the network layer
                  as a way to prevent Internet distributed
                  denial-of-service attacks.},

  abstract =     {Due to the dramatically increasing popularity of the
                  services provided over the public Internet, problems
                  with current mechanisms for control and management
                  of the Internet are becoming apparent. In
                  particular, it is increasingly clear that the
                  Internet and other networks built on the Internet
                  protocol suite do not provide sufficient support for
                  the efficient control and management of traffic,
                  i.e. for Traffic Engineering.  This dissertation
                  addresses the problem of traffic engineering in the
                  Internet. It argues that traffic management
                  techniques should be applied at multiple timescales,
                  and not just at data timescales as is currently the
                  case. It presents and evaluates mechanisms for
                  traffic engineering in the Internet at two further
                  timescales: flow admission control and control of
                  per-flow packet marking, enabling control timescale
                  traffic engineering; and support for load based
                  inter-domain routeing in the Internet, enabling
                  management timescale traffic engineering.  This
                  dissertation also discusses suitable policies for
                  the application of the proposed mechanisms. It
                  argues that the proposed mechanisms are able to
                  support a wide range of policies useful to both
                  users and operators.  Finally, in a network of the
                  size of the Internet consideration must also be
                  given to the deployment of proposed
                  solutions. Consequently, arguments for and against
                  the deployment of these mechanisms are presented and
                  the conclusion drawn that there are a number of
                  feasible paths toward deployment.  The work
                  presented argues the following: firstly, it is
                  possible to implement mechanisms within the Internet
                  framework that enable traffic engineering to be
                  carried out by operators; secondly, that applying
                  these mechanisms with suitable policies can ease the
                  management problems faced by operators and at the
                  same time improve the efficiency with which the
                  network can be run; thirdly, that these improvements
                  can correspond to increased network performance as
                  viewed by the user; and finally, that not only the
                  resulting deployment but also the deployment process
                  itself are feasible.},

  abstract =     {MPLS (Multi-Protocol Label Switching) is a
                  technology with the potential to support multiple
                  control systems, each with guaranteed QoS (Quality
                  of Service), on connectionless best-effort
                  networks. However, it does not provide all the
                  capabilities required of a multi-service network. In
                  particular, although resource-assured VPNs (Virtual
                  Private Networks) can be created, there is no
                  provision for inter-VPN resource management. Control
                  flexibility is limited because resources must be
                  pinned down to be guaranteed, and best-effort flows
                  in different VPNs compete for the same resources,
                  leading to QoS crosstalk.  The contribution of this
                  paper is an implementation on MPLS of a network
                  control framework that supports inter-VPN resource
                  management. Using resource partitions known as
                  switchlets, it allows the creation of multiple VPNs
                  with guaranteed resource allocations, and maintains
                  isolation between these VPNs. Devolved control
                  techniques permit each VPN a customised control
                  system.  We motivate our work by discussing related
                  efforts and example scenarios of effective
                  deployment of our system.  The implementation is
                  described and evaluated, and we address
                  interoperability with external IP control systems,
                  in addition to interoperability of data across
                  different layer 2 technologies.},
