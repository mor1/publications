  abstract =     {This paper outlines the IoT Databox model as a means of making
                  the Internet of Things (IoT) accountable to individuals.
                  Accountability is a key to building consumer trust and
                  mandated in data protection legislation. We briefly outline
                  the {\textquoteleft}external{\textquoteright} data subject
                  accountability requirement specified in actual legislation in
                  Europe and proposed legislation in the US, and how meeting
                  requirement this turns on surfacing the invisible actions and
                  interactions of connected devices and the social arrangements
                  in which they are embedded. The IoT Databox model is proposed
                  as an in principle means of enabling accountability and
                  providing individuals with the mechanisms needed to build
                  trust in the IoT.}

                  introduced topological metric, the weighted spectral
