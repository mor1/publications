  abstract = {Distributed transactional datastores are pivotal in supporting the needs of modern applications and services. Datastores rely on distributed transactional protocols to tolerate faults while also aiming for strong consistency and high performance. State-of-the-art transactional protocols, such as FaRM, provide a lock-free execution phase, thus improving performance and simplifying recovery. However, these protocols often come with lengthy and complicated commit phases, requiring multiple round-trips to commit a transaction (or additional replicas). This completely contrasts with the simplicity and efficiency of the traditional two-phase commit (2PC) protocol, which can commit a transaction after a single round-trip, albeit lacking fault tolerance.To address the limitations of both approaches, we introduce U2PC, a novel 2PC variant that combines simplicity, efficiency, and fault tolerance. U2PC frugally replicates data (f + 1) times to tolerate up to f faults with strong consistency. It offers a single round-trip commit after unanimous responses of all replicas of the involved shards and ensures safe recovery via an extra "pre-abort" round before aborting a transaction. Our verification in TLA+ confirms that U2PC achieves strict serializability and recovers safely. In short, U2PC ensures fault tolerance, optimizes performance for common scenarios, and offers uniform transaction handling.},

  abstract = {Distributed consensus is a fundamental primitive for constructing fault-tolerant, strongly-consistent distributed systems. Though many distributed consensus algorithms have been proposed, just two dominate production systems: Paxos, the traditional, famously subtle, algorithm; and Raft, a more recent algorithm positioned as a more understandable alternative to Paxos.In this paper, we consider the question of which algorithm, Paxos or Raft, is the better solution to distributed consensus? We analyse both to determine exactly how they differ by describing a simplified Paxos algorithm using Raft's terminology and pragmatic abstractions.We find that both Paxos and Raft take a very similar approach to distributed consensus, differing only in their approach to leader election. Most notably, Raft only allows servers with up-to-date logs to become leaders, whereas Paxos allows any server to be leader provided it then updates its log to ensure it is up-to-date. Raft's approach is surprisingly efficient given its simplicity as, unlike Paxos, it does not require log entries to be exchanged during leader election. We surmise that much of the understandability of Raft comes from the paper's clear presentation rather than being fundamental to the underlying algorithm being presented.},

Multi-Paxos reduces this to one phase by electing a leader but this leader is also a performance bottleneck. Fast Paxos bypasses the leader but has stronger quorum intersection requirements. In this paper we observe that Fast Paxos’ intersection requirements can be safely relaxed, reducing to just one additional intersection requirement between phase-1 quorums and any pair of fast round phase-2 quorums. We thus find that the quorums used with Fast Paxos are larger than necessary, allowing alternative quorum systems to obtain new tradeoffs between performance and fault-tolerance.},

  abstract = {Distributed consensus, the ability to reach agreement in the face of failures, is a fundamental primitive for constructing reliable distributed systems. The Paxos algorithm is synonymous with consensus and widely utilized in production. Paxos uses two phases: phase one and phase two, each requiring a quorum of acceptors, to reach consensus during a round of the protocol. Traditionally, Paxos requires that all quorums, regardless of phase or round, intersect and majorities are often used for this purpose. Flexible Paxos proved that it is only necessary for phase one quorum of a given round to intersect with the phase two quorums of all previous rounds.In this paper, we re-examine how Paxos approaches the problem of consensus. We look again at quorum intersection in Flexible Paxos and observe that quorum intersection can be safely weakened further. Most notably, we observe that if a proposer learns that a value was proposed in some previous round then its phase one no longer needs to intersect with the phase two quorums from that round or from any previous rounds. Furthermore, in order to provide an intuitive explanation of our results, we propose a novel abstraction for reasoning about Paxos which utilizes write-once registers.},

  abstract = {A key principle in the design of the Linux kernel's Completely
                  Fair Scheduler (CFS) is fairness: all running tasks receive a
                  minimum time slice during every scheduling period, ensuring
                  that none starve. However, this may lead to a significant
                  number of context switches when a server is overloaded with a
                  large number of colocated tasks, which may cause significant
                  degradation in server performance. Unfortunately, this
                  situation is exactly what we found when hosting
                  serverless-style workloads which typically consist of a large
                  number of short-lived, CPU-bound functions sharing resources.
                  We propose modifying the Linux CFS to mitigate this problem by
                  giving priority to the long tail of least loaded functions.
                  These are the functions which are mostly idle and only run
                  occasionally for a short while after being triggered
                  unexpectedly. The large number of such functions in serverless
                  environments means that prioritising them helps drain
                  contended CPU run queues, reducing the total overhead due to
                  context switching, thereby improving the performance not only
                  of the prioritised functions but other functions as well. We
                  implement this policy in the Linux kernel scheduler and
                  demonstrate how it integrates well with Knative, an open
                  source Kubernetes-based serverless framework. Given contention
                  scenarios synthesised from real-world traces, our modified CFS
                  can introduce a 5--30\% increase in attainment of latency

                  wireless standards and applications. However, besides a large
                  number of IoT benefits, its further development is now being
                  slowed down due to the repetition of old Internet development
                  flaws while dealing with IoT heterogeneity. The current
                  misleading trend aims to solve all IoT interoperation problems
                  by inserting IP Addresses into those wireless protocols where
                  the IP stack clearly slows down application performance and
                  drains the battery, e.g. LPWANs such as LoRaWAN and SigFox.
                  This paper tackles IoT heterogeneity from a different
                  perspective: it is the application interoperation which
                  matters the most. The protocols beneath the application layer
                  shall work for smooth upper-layer service provisioning where
                  the IP shall be just one of the many underlying integration
                  options instead of being the essential one. Inspired by
                  previous proposals for a more flexible internetworking
                  architecture, this paper applies those theoretical concepts in
                  practice by proposing a protocol-independent distributed
                  interoperation model for smooth service provisioning over
                  heterogeneous IoT wireless contexts. The arguments pro the
                  IP-agnostic IoT application interoperation are supported by
                  the model's prototype which showed 1.6-2 times faster MQTT
                  application operation over LoRa and WiFi compared to the
                  legacy IP-based MQTT provisioning over that protocols.},

                  for container orchestration. Kubernetes largely targets the
                  cloud environment but new use cases require performant,
                  available and scalable orchestration at the edge. Kubernetes
                  stores all cluster state in etcd, a strongly consistent
                  key-value store. We find that at larger etcd cluster sizes,
                  offering higher availability, write request latency
                  significantly increases and throughput decreases similarly.
                  Coupled with approximately 30\% of Kubernetes requests being
                  writes, this directly impacts the request latency and
                  availability of Kubernetes, reducing its suitability for the
                  edge. We revisit the requirement of strong consistency and
                  propose an eventually consistent approach instead. This
                  enables higher performance, availability and scalability
                  whilst still supporting the broad needs of Kubernetes. This
                  aims to make Kubernetes much more suitable for
                  performance-critical, dynamically-scaled edge solutions.},

                  the Internet of Things (IoT) accountable to individuals.
                  Accountability is a key to building consumer trust and
                  mandated in data protection legislation. We briefly outline
                  the {\textquoteleft}external{\textquoteright} data subject
                  accountability requirement specified in actual legislation in
                  Europe and proposed legislation in the US, and how meeting
                  requirement this turns on surfacing the invisible actions and
                  interactions of connected devices and the social arrangements
                  in which they are embedded. The IoT Databox model is proposed
                  as an in principle means of enabling accountability and
                  providing individuals with the mechanisms needed to build
                  trust in the IoT.}
