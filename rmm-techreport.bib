  abstract =     {Distributed consensus, the ability to reach agreement in the
                  face of failures and asynchrony, is a fundamental primitive
                  for constructing reliable distributed systems from unreliable
                  components. The Paxos algorithm is synonymous with distributed
                  consensus, yet it performs poorly in practice and is famously
                  difficult to understand. In this paper, we re-examine the
                  foundations of distributed consensus. We derive an abstract
                  solution to consensus, which utilises immutable state for
                  intuitive reasoning about safety. We prove that our abstract
                  solution generalises over Paxos as well as the Fast Paxos and
                  Flexible Paxos algorithms. The surprising result of this
                  analysis is a substantial weakening to the quorum requirements
                  of these widely studied algorithms.}

                  Over the last few years, significant attention has been
                  focused on personal data, particularly data generated by smart
                  wearable and smart home devices. Making personal data
                  available for access and trade is expected to become a part of
                  the data driven digital economy. In this position paper, we
                  review the research challenges in building personal Databoxes
                  that hold personal data and enable data access by other
                  parties, and potentially thus sharing of data with other
                  parties. These Databoxes are expected to become a core part of
                  future data marketplaces.}

                  topology as inferred from two different datasets over a period
                  of seven years. We use a variety of topological metrics to
                  analyze the structural differences revealed in the AS
                  topologies inferred from the two different datasets. In
                  particular, to focus on the evolution of the relationship
                  between the core and the periphery, we make use of the
                  weighted spectral distribution. We find that the traceroute
                  dataset has increasing difficulty in sampling the periphery of
                  the AS topology, largely due to limitations inherent to active
                  probing. Such a dataset has too limited a view to properly
                  observe topological changes at the AS-level compared to a
                  dataset largely based on BGP data. We also highlight
                  limitations in current measurements that require a better
                  sampling of particular topological properties of the Internet.
                  Our results indicate that the Internet is changing from a
                  core-centered, strongly customer-provider oriented,
                  disassortative network, to a soft-hierarchical,

  abstract =     {Comparison of graph structures is a frequently encountered
                  problem across a number of problem domains. Comparing graphs
                  requires a metric to discriminate which features of the graphs
                  are considered important. The spectrum of a graph is often
                  claimed to contain all the information within a graph, but the
                  raw spectrum contains too much information to be directly used
                  as a useful metric. In this paper we introduce a metric, the
                  weighted spectral distribution, that improves on the raw
                  spectrum by discounting those eigenvalues believed to be
                  unimportant and emphasizing the contribution of those believed
                  to be important. We use this metric to optimize the selection
                  of parameter values for generating Internet topologies. Our
                  metric leads to parameter choices that appear sensible given
                  prior knowledge of the problem domain: the resulting choices
                  are close to the default values of the topology generators

  abstract =     {Many models have been proposed to generate Internet Autonomous
                  System (AS) topologies, most of which make structural
                  assumptions about the AS graph. In this paper we compare AS
                  topology generation models with several observed AS
                  topologies. In contrast to most previous works, we avoid
                  making assumptions about which topological properties are
                  important to characterize the AS topology. Our analysis shows
                  that, although matching degree-based properties, the existing
                  AS topology generation models fail to capture the complexity
                  of the local interconnection structure between ASs.
                  Furthermore, we use BGP data from multiple vantage points to
                  show that additional measurement locations significantly
                  affect local structure properties, such as clustering and node
                  centrality. Degree-based properties, however, are not notably
                  affected by additional measurements locations. These
                  observations are particularly valid in the core. The
                  shortcomings of AS topology generation models stems from an
                  underestimation of the complexity of the connectivity in the
                  core caused by inappropriate use of BGP data.},

  abstract =     {The open nature of Internet services has been of great value
                  to users, enabling dramatic innovation and evolution of
                  services. However, this openness permits many abuses of
                  open-access Internet services such as web, email, and DNS. To
                  counteract such abuses, a number of so called proof-of-work
                  schemes have been proposed. They aim to prevent or limit such
                  abuses by demanding potential clients of the service to prove
                  that they have carried out some amount of work before they
                  will be served. In this paper we show that existing
                  resource-based schemes have several problems, and instead
                  propose latency-based proof-of-work as a solution. We describe
                  centralised and distributed variants, introducing the problem
                  class of non-parallelisable shared secrets in the process. We

  abstract =     {Due to the dramatically increasing popularity of the services
                  provided over the public Internet, problems with current
                  mechanisms for control and management of the Internet are
                  becoming apparent. In particular, it is increasingly clear
                  that the Internet and other networks built on the Internet
                  protocol suite do not provide sufficient support for the
                  efficient control and management of traffic, i.e. for Traffic
                  Engineering. This dissertation addresses the problem of
                  traffic engineering in the Internet. It argues that traffic
                  management techniques should be applied at multiple
                  timescales, and not just at data timescales as is currently
                  the case. It presents and evaluates mechanisms for traffic
                  engineering in the Internet at two further timescales: flow
                  admission control and control of per-flow packet marking,
                  enabling control timescale traffic engineering; and support
                  for load based inter-domain routeing in the Internet, enabling
                  management timescale traffic engineering. This dissertation
                  also discusses suitable policies for the application of the
                  proposed mechanisms. It argues that the proposed mechanisms
                  are able to support a wide range of policies useful to both
                  users and operators. Finally, in a network of the size of the
                  Internet consideration must also be given to the deployment of
                  proposed solutions. Consequently, arguments for and against
                  the deployment of these mechanisms are presented and the
                  conclusion drawn that there are a number of feasible paths
                  toward deployment. The work presented argues the following:
                  firstly, it is possible to implement mechanisms within the
                  Internet framework that enable traffic engineering to be
                  carried out by operators; secondly, that applying these
                  mechanisms with suitable policies can ease the management
                  problems faced by operators and at the same time improve the
                  efficiency with which the network can be run; thirdly, that
                  these improvements can correspond to increased network
                  performance as viewed by the user; and finally, that not only
                  the resulting deployment but also the deployment process
                  itself are feasible.},

                  guaranteed QoS (Quality of Service), on connectionless
                  best-effort networks. However, it does not provide all the
                  capabilities required of a multi-service network. In
                  particular, although resource-assured VPNs (Virtual Private
                  Networks) can be created, there is no provision for inter-VPN
                  resource management. Control flexibility is limited because
                  resources must be pinned down to be guaranteed, and
                  best-effort flows in different VPNs compete for the same
                  resources, leading to QoS crosstalk. The contribution of this
                  paper is an implementation on MPLS of a network control
                  framework that supports inter-VPN resource management. Using
                  resource partitions known as switchlets, it allows the
                  creation of multiple VPNs with guaranteed resource
                  allocations, and maintains isolation between these VPNs.
                  Devolved control techniques permit each VPN a customised
                  control system. We motivate our work by discussing related
                  efforts and example scenarios of effective deployment of our
                  system. The implementation is described and evaluated, and we
                  address interoperability with external IP control systems, in
                  addition to interoperability of data across different layer 2
