                  analyze the structural differences revealed in the AS

                  particular, to focus on the evolution of the relationship

                  weighted spectral distribution. We find that the traceroute
                  dataset has increasing difficulty in sampling the periphery of
                  the AS topology, largely due to limitations inherent to active
                  probing. Such a dataset has too limited a view to properly
                  observe topological changes at the AS-level compared to a
                  dataset largely based on BGP data. We also highlight

                  problem across a number of problem domains. Comparing graphs
                  requires a metric to discriminate which features of the graphs
                  are considered important. The spectrum of a graph is often
                  claimed to contain all the information within a graph, but the
                  raw spectrum contains too much information to be directly used
                  as a useful metric. In this paper we introduce a metric, the
                  weighted spectral distribution, that improves on the raw
                  spectrum by discounting those eigenvalues believed to be
                  unimportant and emphasizing the contribution of those believed
                  to be important. We use this metric to optimize the selection
                  of parameter values for generating Internet topologies. Our
                  metric leads to parameter choices that appear sensible given
                  prior knowledge of the problem domain: the resulting choices
                  are close to the default values of the topology generators
                  and, in the case of the AB generator, fall within the expected
                  region. This metric provides a means for meaningfully
                  optimizing parameter selection when generating topologies

  abstract =     {Many models have been proposed to generate Internet Autonomous
                  System (AS) topologies, most of which make structural
                  assumptions about the AS graph. In this paper we compare AS
                  topology generation models with several observed AS
                  topologies. In contrast to most previous works, we avoid
                  making assumptions about which topological properties are
                  important to characterize the AS topology. Our analysis shows
                  that, although matching degree-based properties, the existing
                  AS topology generation models fail to capture the complexity
                  of the local interconnection structure between ASs.
                  Furthermore, we use BGP data from multiple vantage points to
                  show that additional measurement locations significantly
                  affect local structure properties, such as clustering and node
                  centrality. Degree-based properties, however, are not notably
                  affected by additional measurements locations. These
                  observations are particularly valid in the core. The
                  shortcomings of AS topology generation models stems from an
                  underestimation of the complexity of the connectivity in the
                  core caused by inappropriate use of BGP data.},

                  to users, enabling dramatic innovation and evolution of
                  services. However, this openness permits many abuses of
                  open-access Internet services such as web, email, and DNS. To
                  counteract such abuses, a number of so called proof-of-work
                  schemes have been proposed. They aim to prevent or limit such

                  provided over the public Internet, problems with current
                  mechanisms for control and management of the Internet are
                  becoming apparent. In particular, it is increasingly clear
                  that the Internet and other networks built on the Internet
                  protocol suite do not provide sufficient support for the
                  efficient control and management of traffic, i.e. for Traffic
                  Engineering. This dissertation addresses the problem of
                  traffic engineering in the Internet. It argues that traffic
                  management techniques should be applied at multiple
                  timescales, and not just at data timescales as is currently
                  the case. It presents and evaluates mechanisms for traffic
                  engineering in the Internet at two further timescales: flow
                  admission control and control of per-flow packet marking,
                  enabling control timescale traffic engineering; and support
                  for load based inter-domain routeing in the Internet, enabling
                  management timescale traffic engineering. This dissertation
                  also discusses suitable policies for the application of the
                  proposed mechanisms. It argues that the proposed mechanisms
                  are able to support a wide range of policies useful to both
                  users and operators. Finally, in a network of the size of the
                  Internet consideration must also be given to the deployment of
                  proposed solutions. Consequently, arguments for and against
                  the deployment of these mechanisms are presented and the
                  conclusion drawn that there are a number of feasible paths
                  toward deployment. The work presented argues the following:
                  firstly, it is possible to implement mechanisms within the
                  Internet framework that enable traffic engineering to be
                  carried out by operators; secondly, that applying these
                  mechanisms with suitable policies can ease the management
                  problems faced by operators and at the same time improve the
                  efficiency with which the network can be run; thirdly, that
                  these improvements can correspond to increased network
                  performance as viewed by the user; and finally, that not only
                  the resulting deployment but also the deployment process
                  itself are feasible.},

                  best-effort networks. However, it does not provide all the
                  capabilities required of a multi-service network. In
                  particular, although resource-assured VPNs (Virtual Private
                  Networks) can be created, there is no provision for inter-VPN
                  resource management. Control flexibility is limited because
                  resources must be pinned down to be guaranteed, and
                  best-effort flows in different VPNs compete for the same
                  resources, leading to QoS crosstalk. The contribution of this
                  paper is an implementation on MPLS of a network control
                  framework that supports inter-VPN resource management. Using
                  resource partitions known as switchlets, it allows the
                  creation of multiple VPNs with guaranteed resource
                  allocations, and maintains isolation between these VPNs.
                  Devolved control techniques permit each VPN a customised
