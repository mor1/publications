  abstract = { This chapter draws from across the foregoing chapters discussing many core Human Data Interaction (HDI) approaches and disciplinary perspectives to consider the specific application of HDI in home network security. While much work has considered the challenges of securing in-home Internet of Things (IoT) devices and their communications, especially for those with limited power or computational capacity, scant attention has been paid by the research community to home network security, and its acceptability and usability, from the viewpoint of ordinary citizens. It will be clear that we need a radical transformation in our approach to designing domestic networking infrastructure to guard against widespread cyber-attacks that threaten to counter the benefits of the IoT. Our aim has to be to defend against enemies inside the walls, to protect critical functionality in the home against rogue devices and to prevent the proliferation of disruptive wide-scale IoT Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attacks that are already occurring. }

  abstract = { This chapter outlines the IoT Databox model as an in principle means of making the Internet of Things (IoT) accountable to individuals. Accountability is key to building consumer trust and is mandated by the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). We focus here on the external data subject accountability requirement specified by GDPR and how meeting this turns on surfacing the invisible actions and interactions of connected devices and the social arrangements in which they are embedded. The IoT Databox model articulates how this requirement might be met and individuals be provided with the mechanisms needed to build widespread consumer trust into the IoT. }

The chapters in this book cover legal, social science, systems and design research perspectives. Taken together, they seek to enable the broader community to understand the multi-faceted contexts in which the IoT is embedded, to shape systems around societal need and ultimately to drive the development of future and emerging technologies that are responsive to the challenges confronting their adoption in everyday life. }
