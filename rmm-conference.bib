  abstract     = {Both the training and use of Large Language Models (LLMs) require large amounts of energy. Their increasing popularity, therefore, raises critical concerns regarding the energy efficiency and sustainability of data centers that host them. This paper addresses the challenge of reducing energy consumption in data centers running LLMs. We propose a hybrid data center model that uses a cost-based scheduling framework to dynamically allocate LLM tasks across hardware accelerators that differ in their energy efficiencies and computational capabilities. Specifically, our workload-aware strategy determines whether tasks are processed on energy-efficient processors or high-performance GPUs based on the number of input and output tokens in a query. Our analysis of a representative LLM dataset, finds that this hybrid strategy can reduce CPU+GPU energy consumption by 7.5\% compared to a workload-unaware baseline.},

  abstract     = {As smart environments become laden with more and more sensors, there has been a need to develop systems that could derive useful information from these sensors and make the smart environments smarter. Complex Event Processing (CEP) has emerged as a popular strategy to identify crucial events from sensor data. However, the existing CEP strategies overlook the relationship with other sensors in the spatial vicinity and understate the temporal variation of sensor data. In this paper, we develop RACER, which is an end-to-end complex event processing system that takes into consideration both the spatial location of the sensor in observation and the varying impact of temporal changes in the sensor data. Experiments performed for a duration of five months over both collected and live streaming data shows that RACER fares well compared to the other state-of-the-art approaches.},
