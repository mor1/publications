                  networking give rise to numerous challenges regarding the
                  management of the multiple facets of people's digital
                  identities within and around social networking sites (SNS). We
                  propose an architecture for enabling people to better manage
                  their SNS identities that is informed by the way the core
                  Internet protocols developed to support interoperation of
                  proprietary network protocols, and based on the idea of
                  Separation of Concerns [1]. This does not require modification
                  of existing services but is predicated on providing a
                  connecting layer over them, both as a mechanism to address
                  problems of privacy and identity, and to create opportunities
                  to open up online social networking to a much richer set of
                  possible interactions and applications.},

                  that seeks to support end-users in the day-to-day management
                  of their personal digital data. This is a programmatic paper
                  that seeks to elaborate foundational challenges that face HDI
                  from an interactional perspective. It is rooted in and
                  reflects foundational lessons from social studies of science
                  that have had a formative impact on CSCW, and core challenges
                  involved in supporting interaction/collaboration from within
                  the field of CSCW itself. These are drawn upon to elaborate
                  the inherently social and relational character of data and the
                  challenges this poses for the ongoing development of HDI,
                  particularly with respect to the `articulation' of personal
                  data. Our aim in doing this is not to present solutions to the
                  challenges of HDI but to articulate core problems that
                  confront this fledgling field as it moves from nascent concept
                  to find a place in the interactional milieu of everyday life
                  and particular research challenges that accompany it.},

                  enable consumers to combine data they possess with data held
                  about them by businesses and government. We introduce the
                  concept of Dataware as the logical federation of data sources
                  containing {"}my data{"} and discuss an SOA to deliver new and
                  compelling services and applications able to reap the benefits
                  of value-in-use for consumers.}

                  academic community has long pursued completely decentralised
                  approaches to service provision. In this paper we contrast
                  these two extremes, and propose an architecture, Droplets,
                  that enables a controlled trade-off between the costs and
                  benefits of each. We also provide indications of
                  implementation technologies and three simple sample
                  applications that substantially benefit by exploiting these
                  trade-offs.},
