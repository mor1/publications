Dear Gustavo

We have made the changes mentioned below, and I have just submitted a fresh=
 PDF and also a text file summarizing the changes made.

Dear Gustavo

We will add a second set of four graphs (varying N,d,u, and c respectively =
as in the first set), keeping the same default values for N and c as before=
 but with d=3D100 MB and u=3D100 B/s. On both old and new graphs we will ad=
d a fifth curve for PIER using a refresh period of 1 hour.

I must point out that this does not result in any qualititative change: the=
 scalability trends are the same as before (PIER is still not scalable) but=
 the crossover points will shift slightly (although they may change by an o=
rder of magnitude, the difference between the systems is several orders of =
magnitude, which is why we use the log-log scale).

We still do not believe that the new graphs add any information to the exis=
ting ones; however we are doing this in good faith, in the understanding th=
at these new graphs should completely address reviewer 1's concerns.

Regards

Dushyanth and Ant

Dear Dushyanth,

I have received the reply from the reviewer. I think the point being made a=
nd
what the complaint is about is very clear. I would suggest that you add the
experiments indicated.

Regards,

      Gustavo

The main issue with the evaluation is that there are 4 dimensions across wh=
ich
the system is evaluated (N, d, u, c).
The authors take one point in this 4-dimensional space ((300000, 2.6GB, 970=
b/s,
5.5 microsec)) taken from an aggregation of experiences
from different real in-home applications (Anemone, Farsite, Seaweed) and th=
en
traverse one dimension at a time
and show it in the corresponding graph. The authors claim in the rebuttal:
"The underlying issue seems to be that reviewer 1 considers our default
parameter values unrealistic. We obtained these from real-world traces
(summarized in Table 1)
which we are happy to share to let you confirm the values. If reviewer 1 ca=
n
point us at a real-world source for a different set of default values,
we are happy to include a second set of graphs using these."
The merit of the paper is not a system that works for a single environment =
such
as "Anemone" (from where the authors took the value of d =3D 2.6 GB).
Instead the merit lies in showing that the proposed approach works for diff=
erent
profiles showing its limits and comparing it with other approaches.
The current comparison is partial and a somewhat misleading. Currently, in =
3 out
of 4 graphs your are comparing against a worst case of PIER, and a bad case=
 of
centralized,
and this is what I am asking to fix, since it is a biased comparison. you s=
hould
also compare against a good case of PIER and centralized.

Regarding the rebuttal:
"As I understand it, the suggestion is to add extra lines on all graphs wit=
h a
lower value of d for PIER and a lower value of u for centralized. But these
would not be comparable with the existing curves. The point of each graph i=
s to
show the scalability of each approach with a single parameter while fixing
default values for the remaining. So if we give PIER a non-default value fo=
r d
while varying some other parameter then I don't understand how PIER's
performance can be compared against the systems using the default value of =
d.
I'm sure nobody would suggest comparing, for example, TPC-C results for one
system using a 100 MB database with those of another system using a 1 GB da=
tabase."

You can do this in two ways. One is to have a second set of graphs in which=
 the
default parameters are more favorable to PIER and centralized.
The other would be adding new curves for PIER 100MB and similarly for
centralized with a different update rate.
I am not asking comparing pears with apples as you suggest.
You can just tag Seaweed and DHT with both 100MB and 2.6 GB, whilst using
different tags for each curve of PIER.
But this was only a suggestion to save space, you can just provide a second=
 set
of graphs.
Anyway, it does not matter how you do it, the important issue it is to show=
 the
comparison of Seaweed with PIER and centralized
with other reasonable values in which they are more competitive.

Regarding the rebuttal:

"Alternatively we could include a table that clearly states which approache=
s are
sensitive to which parameters, and whether a high or low value of the param=
eter
favours the approach. "

This table certainly would enrich the paper and clarify under which conditi=
ons
each approach can be used.

Finally regarding:
"The other suggestion was a lower refresh rate r for PIER. This is a parame=
ter
that affects only PIER, so we would be happy to add an additional curve to =
all
graphs showing PIER with an update rate of 1 hour. "

This certainly has to be fixed. Fully updating the DB every 5 minutes is
nonsense for medium-large DB sizes.
