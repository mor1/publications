In this article we present the results of a survey we ran to collect data from the networking community, including researchers and practitioners, about how packet filtering is used. In doing so, we identify pain points related to packet filtering, and unmet needs of survey participants. Based on analysis of this survey data, we propose future research and development goals that would support the networking community.},

                  technologies, heralds a world in which pervasive sensing
                  constantly captures data about us. Simultaneous with this
                  technology programme are moves by policymakers to shore up the
                  digital economy through the legislating of new trust-building
                  models of data management. These moves seek to give
                  individuals control and oversight of their personal data.
                  Within shared settings, the consequences of these changes are
                  the large-scale generation of interpersonal data generated by
                  and acting on the group rather than individual. We consider
                  how such systems create new forms of observability and hence
                  accountability among members of the home, and draw on the work
                  of Simmel and Goffman to explore how these demands are
                  managed. Such management mitigates the more extreme
                  possibilities for domestic monitoring posited by these
                  systems, yet without careful design there remains a
                  considerable danger of unanticipated negative consequences. }

                  industries. Independent artists often rely on sharing their
                  work across social media and content-sharing sites, leaving
                  them open to having their work stolen or misused. This paper
                  discusses a series of 11 semi-structured interviews that
                  examined attitudes towards copyright and attribution amongst
                  webcomic artists, in relation to current copyright laws across
                  the EU and internationally. Whilst artists are generally aware
                  of the cover provided by copyright, they feel that it is not
                  necessarily relevant or effective within the creative space
                  they work in. There is very little support and there are few
                  resources available to help them to fight for control of their
                  work, and whilst artists do get angry about actual theft and
                  removal of attribution, they accept that they have to put up
                  with certain violations if they wish to continue to publish
                  comics for free on the Internet. The paper ends by discussing
                  potential solutions to the problems raised.},

                  protection regulation and its relevance to design. From this
                  perspective, proposed regulation in Europe and the USA seeks
                  to create a new economic actor—the consumer as personal data
                  trader—through new legal frameworks that shift the locus of
                  agency and control in data processing towards the individual
                  consumer or “data subject”. The sociological perspective on
                  proposed data regulation recognises the reflexive relationship
                  between law and the social order, and the commensurate needs
                  to balance the demand for compliance with the design of
                  computational tools that enable this new economic actor. We
                  present the Databox model as a means of providing data
                  protection and allowing the individual to exploit personal
                  data to become an active player in the emerging data economy.},

                  being the primary revenue source for most online companies.
                  These companies accumulate extensive personal data about
                  individuals with minimal concern for us, the subjects of this
                  process. This can cause many harms: privacy infringement,
                  personal and professional embarrassment, restricted access to
                  labour markets, restricted access to highest value pricing,
                  and many others. There is a critical need to provide
                  technologies that enable alternative practices, so that
                  individuals can par- ticipate in the collection, management
                  and consumption of their personal data. In this paper we
                  discuss the Databox, a personal networked device (and
                  associated services) that col- lates and mediates access to
                  personal data, allowing us to re- cover control of our online
                  lives. We hope the Databox is a first step to re-balancing
                  power between us, the data subjects, and the corporations that
                  collect and use our data. },

                  the capacity to greatly affect the home, a space that is core
                  to human experience, yet remains understudied owing to its
                  sensitive, semi-private nature. Scenario-based methods have
                  previously been used to collect home technology design
                  responses but they have tended to over-simplify the social
                  contexts involved, and have not taken into account the unique
                  circumstances of the respondents. Technology probes have also
                  been used but suffer from increased costs in research time and
                  effort and a corresponding reduction in participation, as well
                  as decreased acceptance owing to their invasiveness. We
                  present ‘Tailored Scenarios’, a new method for eliciting
                  participant responses involving home-based technologies that
                  dynamically presents participants with scenarios, based on
                  their home contexts, into which new technologies are
                  installed. ‘Tailored Scenarios’ use self-reported contextual
                  data to customize each scenario. We present the method, and
                  report findings from a case study in which we compared
                  responses to ‘Tailored Scenarios’ with those from traditional
                  scenarios and technology probes. Our findings suggest that
                  ‘Tailored Scenarios’ is an improvement over standard scenario
                  methods in terms of eliciting attitudes towards technology and
                  are easier to implement at scale than technology probes.},
